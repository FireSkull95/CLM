        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p class="text-justify"><strong>Why “metal roof” and why CLM Steel Roofing? </strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">Driving through the residential neighbourhoods you might have noticed more and more
                people are opting out for a metal roof. You might ask yourself “Why go for metal roof if you can re-shingle
                the roof at a lower price?” The truth is shingles have lost their longevity and endurance due to a ban on
                asbestos in 1989. Asbestos was a crucial component in shingles as it has great textile strength and provides
                great resistance to chemical damage and weathering. After asbestos was discovered to have direct link to
                cancer Canadian government has outlawed the use of asbestos, and, as a result, the life expectancy of an
                installed asphalt shingle roof is 10-15 years. In addition to low life expectancy there are other reasons
                why asphalt shingles are inferior to a Toronto metal roof:</p>
            <p><strong> Weathering </strong></p>

            <p class="text-justify">Shingles have trouble withstanding harsh Canadian weather, as a result constant
                maintenance and repair is needed which actually increases the life cycle cost of Toronto steel roofing
                drastically </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Steel roofing products offered by CLM Toronto metal roofing are manufactured to
                withstand RC3 levels of corrosion (such levels of corrosion are present in industrial and marine
                environments). With RUV4 level of ultraviolet resistance, our products can tolerate UV rays at altitudes of
                up to 2,100 meters above sea level, which results in minimal discoloration.</p>

            <p><strong>Save on your energy bill! </strong></p>

            <p class="text-justify">During the summer months you might have noticed that it gets very hot in the attic
                without metal roofing. This is due to the fact that shingles soak up the heat from the sun, and due to poor
                ventilation that heat is trapped in the attic and transferred to the rest of the house. This of course
                increases your energy consumption</p>

            <p class="text-justify">Unlike asphalt shingles, metal roof is not installed directly over your roof/shingles. The space between the
                metal and your roof provides airflow and ventilation throughout the roof. In addition to that, metal roof
                reflects 85% of sunlight which means that your attic will not trap heat and your energy costs can be
                decreased by as much as 30% (depending on the property layout). </p>

            <p><strong>Help planet Earth!</strong></p>

            <p class="text-justify">Only about 5% of your shingle roof is recyclable. This means that about 95% of asphalt
                shingles end up in our landfills which will take thousands of year to decompose. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Voestapine metal roofing material is 100% recyclable - this will decrease your
                environmental footprint and give you peace of mind knowing that you are contributing to reducing the amount
                of harmful waste in our landfills. CLM steel roofing in Toronto products are manufactured in Austria by
                steel manufacturer Voestalpine - one of the largest steel manufacturers in the world, and a pioneer when it
                comes to environmentally sustainable steel manufacturing. Since 1998, Voestalpine completely removed
                chromium and chromate from the paint which is used to cover the metal tiles and opted for 100% organic
                substitutes. This actually increased the durability of metal roofing and made it even more environmentally
                compatible.</p>

            <p><strong>Read the fine print when it comes to warranty</strong></p>

            <p class="text-justify">Asphalt shingle manufacturers offer warranties of up to 50 years. However, in the fine
                print you will discover that only the first 3-5 years are completely covered by the warranty. After the
                initial period the pro-rated warranty takes over, which means that, depending on when the roof was installed
                and the thickness of the shingles, you may only be eligible for as little as 10% of the value of the
                product.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">CLM metal roofing in Toronto is confident in the quality of its products. As a result,
                we offer lifetime warranty on all of our residential roofing materials. Backed by guarantees from our steel
                manufacturer Voestalpine, we are able to offer non pro-rated warranty for 50 years, as well as partial
                reimbursement after the 50 year period. In addition to that, the warranty is transferable to the next owner
                within the first 10 year. Metal roofs are manufactured to last for many decades and at CLM metal roofing in
                Toronto we know that if any issues arise, it is most likely due to improper installation, which usually is
                discovered within the first 1-2 years. That is why CLM metal roofing in Toronto also offers 5 year
                workmanship guarantee on all of our residential installations, which means that if any issues were to arise
                as result of improper installation your roof will be replaced at no cost to you.</p>
